# Phore-iOS
Welcome to the Phore Mobile Wallet for iOS. This Wallet is built with React Native using the Create React Native App CLI. 

More information at https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app.

```

npm install -g create-react-native-app

```

##### Note: This app is currently under development and is not complete. 

## Getting Started

```

git clone https://github.com/phoreproject/Phore-iOS.git

cd Phore-iOS

npm install

```


Next, you have a few commands to choose from to run the Wallet.

```

npm start

```

Runs the Wallet in development mode with an interactive prompt. To run it without a prompt, use the --no-interactive flag. 
Open it in the [Expo app](https://expo.io/) on your phone to view it. 

```

npm run iOS

```

Like npm start, but also attempts to open the Wallet in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed. 

```

npm run android

```

You can also run this Wallet in Android. npm run android is like npm start, but also attempts to open the Wallet on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools.
